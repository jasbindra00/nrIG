<h2>How have I used this to grow my Instagram pages?</h2>
<p>Find a bunch of target accounts who serve your target audience or share the same content as you. Iterate through each account. Get a list of all of their followers. Follow them. Get a list of all of their following. Follow them. Unfollow everyone who doesn't follow you (otherwise the follower to following will get too high and so you will look like a spam account; no one will want to follow you back.). Leave it on all night.</p>


<h3>I'm currently gaining around 80 followers a day with this method.</h3>
