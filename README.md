<h2>How have I used this to grow my Bath Sikh Society's Instagram Page?</h2>
<p>Easy. Find a bunch of target accounts; in this case it was the instagram accounts for Sikh Societies at other universities. Get a list of all of their followers. Follow them. Get a list of all of their following. Follow them. Unfollow everyone who doesn't follow you (otherwise the follower to following will get too high and so you will look like a spam account; no one will want to follow you back.). Repeat. Leave it on all night.</p>


<h3>I'm currently gaining around 80 followers a day with this method.</h3>
